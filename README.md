# Agribusiness Architechture

## Project Overview

### Project Name
Agribusiness Management System

### Mission
Build a simple, reliable farm operations system that replaces paper records and helps manage:

- Crop planting
- Harvest tracking
- Customer records
- Orders
- Payments

The system should prioritize:

1. Simplicity
2. Reliability
3. Fast data entry
4. Easy maintenance
5. Future scalability

Version 1 is intentionally small and focused.

---

## Version 1 Goals

### Problem 1: Crop Lifecycle Management

Track:

- Crops
- Planting dates
- Expected harvest dates
- Harvest records

Benefits:

- Never forget planting dates
- Automatically predict harvest windows
- View upcoming harvests
- Receive harvest reminders

---

### Problem 2: Customer & Sales Management

Track:

- Customers
- Orders
- Payments
- Outstanding balances, i.e. [...]

Benefits:

- Eliminate paper records
- Reduce lost information
- Quickly retrieve customer history
- Monitor unpaid balances

---

## Technology Stack

### Backend

- Django

Responsibilities:

- Authentication
- Business logic
- Database interaction
- Notifications

---

### Database

- PostgreSQL

Reasons:

- Free
- Reliable
- Fast
- Excellent Django integration
- Easy migrations

### Frontend

Version 1:

- Django Templates
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

Avoid React until there is a clear business need (and of course until you've actually learned some of it 🥲)

---

## Core Design Philosophy

### Store Facts, Calculate Results

Store:

- Planting dates
- Harvest records
- Orders
- Payments

Calculate:

- Harvest windows (i.e. maturity duration)
- Available stock
- Outstanding balances

Avoid duplicate data whenever possible.

## APP RESPONSIBILITIES

### accounts

Handles:
- Login
- Logout
- Permissions
- User roles

Roles:
- Admin
- Staff

---

### crops

#### ```Field (i.e., Block)```

Fields:
- name
- size
- contained_plantings (list or tuple)

#### ```Crop```

Fields:
- name
- maturity_days
- unit
- description

Example:

Tomatoes
- maturity_days = 90
- unit = kg

---

#### ```Planting```

Fields:
- crop
- planting_date
- field_name

Status values will be computed dynamically, no need to store in variables.

---

### harvests

#### ```Harvest```

Fields:
- planting
- harvesting_date
- quantity_harvested
- notes

Relationship:

Field<br>
⇣<br>
Crop<br>
⇣<br>
Planting<br>
⇣<br>
Harvest

A planting can have multiple harvest records.

Example:

Planting: Tomatoes

Harvest 1: 150kg<br>
Harvest 2: 120kg<br>
Harvest 3: 90kg

---

### customers

#### ```Customer```

Fields:
- name
- phone
- location
- notes
- created_at

---

### sales

Relationship structure:

```
Customer → Order → OrderItem → Payment
```

#### ```Order```

Fields:
- customer
- order_date
- total_amount

#### ```OrderItem```

Fields:
- 

---

#### ```Payment```

Fields:
- order
- amount_paid
- payment_date

Outstanding balance should always be calculated.

Never use a simple paid/unpaid Boolean, i.e. this is unrealistic

---

### dashboard

Displays:
- Upcoming harvests (calendar feature)
- Available stock
- Oustanding balances
- Recent orders

Contains no business logic.

---

## Harvest Window Logic

Harvest Start:
```planting_date + maturity_days```

Harvest End:
```harvest_start + 3 days```

These values should be calculated dynamically.

Do not store them initially.

---

## Inventory Strategy

Version 1 does not require a dedicated inventory app.

Available Stock:

### Total Harvested [to be reviewed!!]

Total Sold

=

Available Stock

Example:

Harvested = 500kg<br>
Sold = 320kg

Available = 180kg

Create a dedicated inventory app only when inventory complexity justifies it.

---

## Calendar Feature

Required.

Calendar should display:
- Planting dates
- Harvest windows
- Upcoming harvests

Primary view:<br>
Month Calendar (with days, ofc.)

---

## Notification System

Version 1:

Use email reminders to notify farmers on harvests due within 3 days.

Future options to consider:
- SMS
- WhatsApp
- Push notifications

---

## Authentication Strategy

Version 1:
- Django Authentication
- Username
- Password

Do **not** implement:
- Google Login
- Facebook Login
- OAuth Providers

For all the right reasons, do *NOT*. Besides, this is just version 1 🤷‍♀️...

Only do employ this stuff to work when a *real* need exists.

---

## Future Features (Not Version 1)

Potential future additions:

- Weather Integration
- Expense Tracking
- Employee Management
- Yield Analytics
- Mobile App
- Inventory App
- Customer Invoicing
- AI Forecasting

These features should not influence Version 1 architecture.

---

## Development Roadmap

### Sprint 1

- Authentication
- Crop CRUD
- Planting CRUD
- Customer CRUD

### Sprint 2
- Harvest Recording
- Orders
- Payments
- Outstanding Balances

### Sprint 3
- Dashboard
- Calendar
- Email Notifications

### Sprint 4
- Deployment
- User Testing
- Bug Fixes

## Personal Notes 🐱‍👤

Make sure to properly create a virtual environment that will streamline 
your workflow and practically save you from excruciating *PAIN* later on.

#### Uhh... why use a virtual environment in the first place?

Listen up. Think of a venv as a private toolbox for one project. It basically
isolates ur projects into separate environments, preventing them from 
sharing ur system-wide Python installation, which can get messy the more ur project 
ages and becomes more complex.

Consider the example below [*Courtesy of ChatGPT*]:

Without venv:
```
Windows Python
├── Django 5.2
├── Pillow 11
├── NumPy
├── Pandas
├── ...
```

With venv:
```
Farm System
└── venv/
    ├── Django 5.2
    ├── Pillow
    └── Whitenoise

Another Project
└── venv/
    ├── Django 4.2
    └── Requests
```

Each project gets its **own** isolated environment.

And... for *this* project specifically, we're going pretty serious with
- Django
- Authentication
- Static files
- Media uploads
- Database drivers
- Production deployment

### Useful .venv actions/commands or whatever...

- Inside ```farm_system```, create the virtual environment as follows:

```
python -m venv .venv
```

- Then activate it:

```
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

- Next, reinstall Django (Do this!!! ❌):
```
pip install django
```

- Thereafter, save dependencies:
```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Now your project becomes portable :)
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

So use a venv. Stay safe... and use A **VENV**! 🐱‍👤 (Purr...)


## Golden Rule

Before adding any feature ask:

"Does this solve a real farm problem today?"

If the answer is no: do not build it yet.

## DOMAIN MAP (Models are Born Here)

If this is my domain map, then I probably should create separate apps for them?

```

Order
